| 📋 Content Strategy | Builds your content pillars, posting schedule, and brand roadmap |
| ✍️ Content Generation | Writes ready-to-post TikTok/Instagram scripts and a brand pitch email |

| 🎯 Optimization | Turns data into prioritised improvements and A/B tests |
| 📅 Publishing & Schedule | Creates a weekly posting calendar with reminders |

## How We Built It
We built CreatorCrew in one day at the AG2 Hackathon in NYC. The core of the app is a six-agent pipeline powered by AG2 (formerly AutoGen), where each agent has a single responsibility — from profiling the audience to generating scripts to scheduling posts. We used Google Gemini 2.5 Flash via OpenRouter as the LLM backbone, Tavily for live web search to ground the agents in real data, and Streamlit to ship a polished UI fast.
